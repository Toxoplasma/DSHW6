Main Manager
============
Top of the system. Users login to this manager and can talk directly with this 
manager for overall stats of past tournaments.

    * Handles players logging in. When it receives a new player registration, it adds the player to its list of players and sends an acknowledgment to the player.
      	1. New player -> Simply add the player to the list of players, and store their password/key.
      	2. Not a Player ->
      			Notify all active Tournament Managers of the login and add them to the list of players.
    * Keeps track of who is currently logged (by monitoring each player and 
      adding/removing them to/from a list of current players).
    * Keeps track of past tournament stats (win/loss of tournaments) for each player.
    * Receives external command to start a yahtzee tournament with 2^m (m > 0) 
      slots and k (k > 0 and odd) games per match.
      Starts the tournament with as many as possible of the currently logged in 
      players (first come, first served), and fills empty slots with "byes."
    * Receives and handles requests from the environment for players' stats.
    * Receives stats from Tournament Manager(s) to add to players' stats

Tournament Manager
==================

Manages an individual tournament. Main Manager starts this process up with a 
list of players, a tournament size (power of two, so 'm' is sent assuming size 2^m),
and a number of games per match (k > 0 and odd).

    * Runs the tournament:
      - Determine the brackets.
      - Starts up matches between players with a Match Manager.
      - Receives results from matches, used to determine next round and eventually a winner.
    * Keep track of tournament stats for each player
    * Keeps track of which players are in the tournament still (ones that haven't lost)
    * Keeps track (through monitoring) of which players are still logged in
    * Can receive login messages from Main Manager:
      - If the player is still in the tournament, then it finds out which match 
        the player was in and sends that Match Manager a login message
      - If the player is not in the tournament, then don't do anything
    * When player is eliminated from the tournament (loses) or wins the entire 
      tournament, send the stats for that player to the Main Manager to keep 
      track of.
    * Shuts down after tournament is finished


Match Manager
=============

Manages a match of 'k' games (k > 0 and is odd) between two players. Each game
is dealt with by a Game Manager. Returns results of match to Tournament Manager.


    * Keeps track of all stats of each completed game (received from Game
      Managers) for the two players.
    * Monitors both players. Can receive join message from Tournament Manager to 
      have the player rejoin in time for next game
    * Handles crashed players by making them forfeit the match if they're not 
      back within a reasonable amount of time
    * Handles ties and "byes" as per the specs
    * After sending stats/results to Tournament Manger at the end of the match, shutdown


Game manager
============

Plays out one game with two players (until score card is filled out for both). 
Sends result of game to Match Manager. Is initialized with results of previous games 
in the match so that it can tell the players of their current standing in the match.

	* Communicates with the players during each turn to give them dice rolls
	* Keeps track of the score and verifies that neither player is cheating.
	* Watches for either player crashing and handles that.
	* Reports the outcome of the game to the match manager.

States: Assembly phase, Scoring phase

* Note: Cheating is checked at every stage/message very simply. No direct 
        communication between players is allowed.

Assembly phase:
	1. When the GM enters the assembly phase, it generates the 15 dice rolls for 
	   the turn, and sends the first five to each player. 
	2. The players reply with their choice of keepers.
	3. When the GM receives this message, it will send them the set of five dice
	   rolls it has now (the keepers from the previous roll plus the re-rolls take
	   from the list). This message is tagged as the first re-roll. The player 
	   will again reply with their choice of keepers.
	4. When the GM receives this second set of keepers, it replies with the final
	   set of five dice values, and enters the scoring phase. This message is 
	   tagged as final dice.
	
scoring phase:
	1. In the scoring phase, the players will send the GM their choice for which
	   box to put their score for this turn in, and the GM will record this. 
	   After this, it will check to see if the game is over or if there are more 
	   turns (boxes to fill out for either player).
	2. If it is over, it reports the results of the game to its Match Manager.
	   Otherwise, it returns to the assembly phase and thus starts another turn.


Player Process
==============

Players can register/login. They also respond to messages from Game Managers with
their choices. THe player expects all information about the game/match from these
messages, and simply replies what it would do in such a game state.

	* Registers with Main Managers, by sending username/password login attempts
	* Waits for success message from Main Manager so they know they're logged in.
	* Plays matches/games against other players, as managed by MMs and GMs. 
	  Only GM will interact directly with the player

A Player process only has one state, from which it reacts to all game messages. 
It also stores no data at all; instead, all messages sent to players will contain 
all relevant information for that message. For example, a game message will 
contain all info so far about that game including current dice, scorecard, etc., 
as well as about the match (such as the win/losses so far and number of games in 
the match), which matches were lost due to crashing, etc. This way, players can 
handle crashes quite elegantly, as it simply rejoins and registers with the main 
manager, and waits to receive messages and handles them normally. 


Messages in the system
======================

Start a Tournament:
  Message from the environment to a main manager telling it to start up a tournament. When a main manager receives this, it will compute the players that should be in the tournament and start up a TM, passing it the list of players, the size of the tournament, and the number of games in each match.

Stat request:
  Message from the environment to a main manager asking for stats about a specific player. The main manager can then respond with the stats, since it keeps track of stats for each player.

Stats response:
  sent by a main manager to the requester. This messages contains all stats that we keep track of for the requested player.

Player registration:
  Sent by a player to the main manager when it joins. If the main manager hasn't seen that player before, it simply adds it to the list of players. If it has, it will send all the TMs a notification that that player has rejoined, in case he is in any ongoing tournaments. It will then reply to the player with an acknowledgement that he is logged in.

Registration acknowledgement:
  Sent by the main manager to a player to let the player know that they are logged in.

Rejoin notification:

Rejoin notification:
  Sent by the TM to an MM when a player in that MM has logged back in. The MM will then continue running the match.
