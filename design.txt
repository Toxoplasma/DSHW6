Game manager
============
Responsibilities:
	Manages a single game between two players.
	Communicates with the players during each turn to give them dice rolls.
	Keeps track of the score and verifies that neither player is cheating.
	Watches for either player crashing and handles that.
	Reports the outcome of a game to the match manager.

States: Assembly phase, Scoring phase

Assembly phase:
	When the GM enters the assembly phase, it generates the 15 dice rolls for the turn, and sends the first five to the players in a {turn starting} message. The players will reply with their choices for which dice they are keeping and which they are rerolling.
	When the GM receives this message, it will reply with a {first modification attempt} message containing the player's new set of 5 dice values. The player will again reply with their choice.
	When the GM receives this second set of choices, it replies with a {second modification attempt} message containing the player's final set of five dice values, and enters the scoring phase.
	
scoring phase:
	In the scoring phase, the players will send the GM their choice for which box to put their score for this turn in, and the GM will record this. Here, it will check that neither player is trying to cheat in any way. After this, it will check to see if the game is over or if there are more rounds.
	If it is over, it reports the results of the game to its match manager. Otherwise, it returns to the assembly phase and thus starts another turn.


Player
======
Responsibilities:
	Registers with one or more main managers
	Plays matches/games against other players, as managed by MMs and GMs

A player process only has one state, from which it reacts to all messages. It also stores no data at all; instead, all messages sent to players will contain all relevant information for that message. For example, a game message will contain all info so far about that game including current dice, scorecard, etc., as well as about the match (such as the score so far), which matches were lost due to crashing, etc. This way, players can handle crashes quite elegantly, as it simply rejoins and registers with the main manager, and waits to receive messages and handles them normally. 


Messages in the system
======================

Turn Starting:
	Sent by GMs, received by players. Contains everything about the tournament state so far that the player could possibly care about, as well as the initial set of 5 dice values the player rolls for the turn.

Turn Starting Reply:
	Sent by players to GMs. Contains the player's decision
